Multiple RF reader modules were localized by using received signal strength value from stationary RF tags. Localization algorithm was implemented on an FPGA.

## Summary

<p style="text-align:justify;">
In this study, a RFID based indoor localization algorithm and a RFID mutual
authentication protocol is implemented by hardware software co-design techniques.
Firstly, background knowledge is given related with used tools and software, as well as
the important concepts regarding indoor localization. After that part, implemented
algorithms and protocols is presented for a better comprehension about the topic.
In the implementation Chapters, hardware implementation of LANDMARC indoor
localization algorithm and the software implementation of Molnar-Wagner Mutual
Authentication Protocol is presented in details, respectively. Verilog hardware description
language and Xilinx’s ISE Design Suite are used for hardware implementation, whereas
C++ programming language, MicroBlaze soft-processor and Xilinx’s XPS tools are used
for software implementation.
